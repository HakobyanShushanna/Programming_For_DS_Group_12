## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Count the occurrences of each unique value in the 'album_type' column
album_counts <- table(data$album_type)
percentages <- album_counts / sum(album_counts) * 100


# Create a pie chart
pie(album_counts, labels = paste(album_counts, uniques, "\n", round(percentages, 1), "%"), col = pastel_colors,
    main = "Proportion of Albums by Album Type", cex.main = 2,     radius = 1.08)
